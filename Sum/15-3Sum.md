# 15. 3Sum

A much harder version of 2 sum. The strategy is to use two pointers.

1. First sort the array, it must be sorted in order for it to work.

2. Then we use a for loop to iterate through the sorted array. We want to avoid duplicates so it is necessary to have this line
```java
if (i>0 && nums[i] == nums[i -1]) continue;
```

3. We use a partial sum . The idea is that the partial sum plus nums[i] will equal zero.
```java

int sum = 0 - nums[i];

```

4. If the partial sum of nums[high] and nums[low] is met , we add a list into our list. then we skip through all the duplicates again with this while loops. This is to ensure the low and high does not encounter more duplicates. We have already did it with the i pointer, but we still need to do it for low and high!

```java

while (low < high && nums[low] == nums[low + 1])low++;
while (low < high && nums[high] == nums[high - 1])high--;

```

5. The we increment low and decrement high so that the pointers will be outside the duplicates.

6. If the sum of  nums[high] and nums[low] is higher than our target partial sum, we need to bring high down. This works because it is sorted.

7. Else if the sum is lower, the brring low higher to increase the partial sum. This strategy will work!

Hint
Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation: 
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: []
Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [0,0,0]
Output: [[0,0,0]]
Explanation: The only possible triplet sums up to 0.


Constraints:

3 <= nums.length <= 3000
-105 <= nums[i] <= 105
